/// Repairs structurally-illegal board readings by reusing the square CNN's own
/// per-cell class distribution — the information `OnnxSquareClassifier` already
/// computes and would otherwise throw away.
///
/// The per-square classifier reads each cell independently and greedily, so a
/// real diagram misread on a square or two routinely produces a FEN that no
/// engine can analyse: three kings, a pawn on the back rank, nine pawns. A
/// per-square model can never prevent this — "one king per side" is a *global*
/// constraint it never sees. So we enforce the hard constraints here, after the
/// fact, by demoting the *lowest-confidence offending* squares to their
/// next-best class until the board is structurally legal.
///
/// This is deterministic, runs in microseconds, and is model-agnostic: it works
/// on whatever softmax the classifier emits today and keeps working if the model
/// is retrained or swapped. It only ever *demotes* a misread square — it never
/// invents a piece — so a genuinely king-less reading stays king-less and is
/// handled downstream by the display-only fallback (`tryLoadFen`).
